# About Me!

I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at Boise State University (Go Broncos!)
I have a cybersecurity emphasis.
I enjoy golfing, watching football, playing video games, and most importantly hanging out with friends!
After I graduate college, I hope to eventually get into the FBI's Cybercrime Division!
